            <h1>House DJ Set</h1>
                <p>House is a genre of Electronic Music that is characterized with a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat and a typical tempo of 120 to 130 BPM. The genre was created by DJs and producers from the Chicago underground scene in the 1980s, as DJs in the sub-culture began to alter disco songs to add deeper basslines and more mechanical beat.</p>
                <p>The genre was pioneered by DJs from Chicago and New York City such as Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E, Steve Hurley, and Farley Funk, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and others. The genre grew internationally to London, other American cities in the Chicago club and is now becoming a worldwide phenomenon. Today, the genre is preserved with popular acts such as DJ Boring and Disclosure, representing two of the best House Sets in the BR platform.</p>

                <tr><td><p>DJ BORING or Tristan Hallis can be one of the most ironically named producers/DJs today. With energetic journeys into hidden gems and future classics, nothing about his sets are boring. DJ Boring inhabits a space where 90s trance mixes well with the old-school house and Belgium techno syncs. Boring meets each mix physically with highly infectious performances that are compelling to watch in the Studio. Whether it's Detroit techno-inspired or Chicago house layered with obscure Youtube samples, his productions are birthed in hardware and imbued with energetic personality â€“ something that is lacking in many electronic music productions today. The unique trait shines through in his new live show, where controllers and hardware become an extension of his vibrant and creative self, manifesting into a fresh take of his music.</p></td><td><p>Disclosure is an English electronic music duo that consists of brothers Howard and Guy Lawrence. They grew in Reigate, Surrey. Their debut studio album, "Settle," was released on 3 June 2013 by PMR records, nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards. Afterward, on 25 September 2015, they released their second studio album, Caracal, which was also nominated for the Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards. Their third studio album, Energy, was released on 28 August 2020. They were nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 2021 Grammy Awards, alongside the fourth single from the album, "My High," which was nominated for Best Dance Recording. Personally, Disclosure is one of my top DJs that I adore the most, where "What's in your head" produced under the Album Settle is the best house track that I have listened to in a while. Disclosure never disappoints with a mix of old-school and new sounds as the duo always delivers the best out of the house music genre.</p></td></tr>
