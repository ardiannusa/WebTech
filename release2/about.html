        <p>Boiler Room (BR) is an online music broadcasting platform based in London, which commissions and streams live underground music sessions from various countries worldwide. Founded in 2010, BR has hosted live shows in over 100 cities globally. This includes regular operations in major hotspots such as New York, Amsterdam, London, Berlin, Lisbon, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Krakow, Tokyo, Sydney, Lima, and LA, where the platform produces on average 30 new shows per month. The music programming of the platform focuses mainly on underground electronic music genres such as House, Techno, Garage, but now has extended to include Grime, Hip Hop, and Jazz.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to The Guardian, by 2015, BR had streamed over 3.5 billion minutes of music and an audience up to 400,000 per broadcast. BR captured a significant amount of following between 2017 and 2017 due to several creative marketing strategies and new initiatives that include series and documentaries of the underground scene worldwide. Since 2018, BR has launched 4:3 by BR system, a program created in partnership with Gaika that uncovers the impact of migration on music: the borderless cultural movement that grows from underground subcultures to worldwide mainstream success; contemporary scenes, exploring underground collectives, artists, and subcultures from around the world; and low heat, a documentary of parties and films celebrating the emergence of new artists.</p>

        <p>Hi folks, my name is Ardian Sukamdani, and I am a 21-year-old Boiler Room fan from Indonesia. Although I was born in Singapore, I have lived my whole life in Jakarta, Indonesia. I am currently residing in Boston, MA, to finish my undergraduate education at Babson College. My love for Boiler Room and the underground electronic music scene, in general, began four years ago, when I first came to Boston. During that time, people knew me as an indie person and hip-hop person that liked to listen to 2Pac, Goldlink, and Rex Orange County all day, all night. This changed 100% when a senior who was a techno enthusiast at that time invited me to go to this underground rave place in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where all the legendary house and techno DJ play their groovy tracks. The experience opened my mind, and I fell in love instantly with the energy and vibration of the underground house scene. After that event, my seniors introduced me to different DJ sets available on a platform that was alien to me – Boiler Room. Despite my unfamiliarity with the platform, I browsed through all the DJ sets in BR’s YT account; the platform instantly became the gateway for me to explore the house and music techno music. Flash forward four years later; I have now gone to more than ten techno festivals and 3 BR DJ sets in Europe and NY.</p>
