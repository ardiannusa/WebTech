              <div><p class="timeline__paragraph">
                In March  2010, Blaise Nelville invited Thristian Richards and NTS Radio Founder, Femi Adeyemi to record a dj session for his magazine platform. This initiative coincided with Bellville trying to persuade investors to convert a warehouse into artist studios.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="timeline__paragraph">
                The format was really simple, although entirely Do-It-Yourself (DIY). A web camera pointed to the front of the deck, while group of people danced behind the guest DJ. Soon, many people began to come to the session regularly. It created a new experience that combined the feeling of being fly on the wall of an event from afar with the excitement of dance music.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="timeline__paragraph">
                By the end of the first year, BR had hosted many famous underground house and techno DJs such as Theo Parrish, Jammie xx, SBTRKT, Hudson Mohawke, Jamie Woon, Mount Kimbie, Falty DL, James Blake, and Ben UFO.

              <br>
              <div><p class="timeline__paragraph">
                In August 2011, BR decided it was time to take their show on the road, and share the experience to the rest of the world, First stop was Germany, in which music festival curator Michael Stangl ran of the first show in Germany. Belville, Thristian and the rest of the crew decided they need a superstar DJ to become the anchor of the lineup. They got Diplo.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="timeline__paragraph">
                “Diplo Played the most awful set ever” as Belville reminisced about Diplo’s set in Germany. “He’s a great DJ, but he thought he was in Vegas. Things like that provoked the reaction online that helped us find our voice. It allowed people to come together and say: “this is sh*t”. It was a turning point for BR because they now realised that they would not get bigger if they turn commercial. The fan base liked underground music and so did the co-founders.

              <br>
              <div><p class="timeline__paragraph">
                The BR team realized it wasn’t time to go commercial and instead focuses their initiatives on local scenes around the world. The key was finding hidden gem in different hubs as the online audience demanded more underground music sessions.
            </p>
            <br>
              <p class="timeline__paragraph"> 
                Snapping up a ticket to a BR show was in itself a flex, but the cultural clout of being on camera at BR became attached with the brand. Soon people were watching streams to catch an audience making fool of themselves or becoming the next best meme.

              <div><p class="timeline__paragraph">
                Many could say grimes pushed BR over the edge because soon enough, the brand was no longer characterised by dance music. A shift to classical music was an unexpected turn. Still, sets by composer Ryuichi Sakamoto and contemporary composers Nils Frahm signalled an exciting departure from the old structure of the show.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="timeline__paragraph">
                As more genres are covered, the shows themselves became bigger. “We did a broadcast from a Roman amphitheatre at Dimensions festival with darkside and Caribou” Belville told the fader in 2016. It was beyong what BR had achieved, and they were able to pull it off successfully. It opened doors for the platform, where the platform took the same policy and implement it to other things that has nothing to do with DJ Sets.

                Ask anyone who attended a BR show, and many would agree that it is absurdly fun. It wasn’t before long the brand began to explore different corners of the world to bring its hedonistic experience. In 2016, BR came to china to get the infamous London underground music, beginning with the set from Disclosure.

                <br>
                <p class="timeline__paragraph">
                But this grand occasion was overshadowed by another issue bubbling under the surface for nearly five years of the streaming’s existence. BR streaming service, which as accompanied by a chatroom that encouraged discussion, community and transparency had taken an ugly turn.

                  After reaching the peak of streaming with ventures in VR, BR turned into documentaries. BR launched a weekly series exploring overlooked music genres as well as a morning chat called Breakfast With Shy.

                <br>
                <p class="timeline__paragraph">
                  “We’ve had our roots in real-life experiences.” Said chief content officer Stephen Mai. In the crowded market of digital content, the regular connection with the audience means that the audience have special connection with the brand. There are so many stories that weren’t being told around music, subcultures, and youths in general. These factors present massive opportunities for BR to grow new audiences.
